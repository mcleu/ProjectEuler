# It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along
# the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that
# 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime;
# that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
# 
# If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above,
# a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed.
# If this process is continued, what is the side length of
# the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals
# first falls below 10%?
